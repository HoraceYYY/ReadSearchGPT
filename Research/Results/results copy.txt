Summary: AI startup Lang.ai specializes in customer service automation. Its platform uses AI to extract concepts from customer requests in existing help desk platforms like Zendesk and Intercom, and automatically tags customer conversations to resolve service issues. The no-code product appends incoming messages, including emails and texts, with labels like “Talk to agent,” “Delivery issue” and “Platform question.” Using Lang, companies can visually group concepts identified in customer support data and set up automations that trigger with specific labels (e.g. respond to questions about package deliveries with boilerplate text). Lang partners with vendors developing frontend and backend customer service automation products, such as business intelligence tools, to sell Lang as a complementary offering. It counts Stitch Fix, Ramp, Hippo Insurance and Freshly among its customers. The annual recurring revenue has grown 11x in the last five quarters preceding Lang's Series A funding round, which raised $10.5 million in funding led by Nava Ventures, bringing its total raised to $15 million.
