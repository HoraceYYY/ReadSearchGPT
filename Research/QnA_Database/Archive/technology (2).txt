Advanced manufacturing and value chains; Manufacturing is positioned to address global megatrends and to serve as a role model for a triple-bottom-line mindset.
Representing more than 20% of the planet’s carbon footprint190 and contributing to approximately 16% of global gross domestic product (GDP),191 manufacturing companies are positioned to drive responsible growth while addressing the complex challenges raised by consumers, climate change and digital transformation. 
The challenges include: 
– New consumer behaviours. The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply changed how consumers select and buy products, and how they expect to be engaged by companies. Consumers seek frictionless purchases, full transparency of product information, and personalized products, which require new levels of performance and agility from manufacturing and supply chains. 
– Climate change and the imperative of a net-zero-emissions world. Current challenges have elevated the importance of manufacturing companies in cutting CO2 emissions and creating circular business models. 
– Digital transformation and disruption. To remain competitive in markets transforming with digital players and new entrants, manufacturing companies must go beyond digitalizing operations and leveraging investments in advanced manufacturing to transform their operating and business models. 
– The future of work. Work is shifting to become more agile and flexible: the type of jobs and skills needed are changing, while employees are rethinking their work expectations regarding volume, location, opportunities for advancement and work-life balance. Companies can leverage these two developments by focusing on workforce empowerment and retraining – satisfying changing expectations of employees while developing the necessary skill set for the future. 
In addition, the risk profile associated with manufacturing and value chains has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with global events and growing challenges – such as the temporary blockage of the Suez Canal in 2021 or continuously increasing cybersecurity threats – become more prevalent, complex and pressing. 

Manufacturing companies must be empowered to embrace advanced manufacturing towards more responsible and resilient growth. 
Manufacturing is positioned to address global megatrends and to model a triple-bottom line mindset that benefits not only profits, but also people and the planet. This vision can be summarized under three strategic pillars: 
1. Unlocking innovation in products, technologies and business models: Companies unlock and deploy innovative products, technologies and business models to create new value and transform production industries with a positive impact on society. 
2. Moving to sustainable value creation: Sustainability in production is not just a vision and an explicit goal but also an enabler that can help achieve other targets. During challenges, such as hiring employees and rising energy and regulatory costs, striving for more responsible production benefits not only shareholders, but also the whole ecosystem in which a company is integrated. Moving towards circular value chains and net negative carbon manufacturing is imperative for a company to become more inclusive and sustainable. Companies drive sustainable and profitable growth, set plans to achieve carbon neutrality and commit to ESG reporting throughout manufacturing and production value chains. 
3. Driving inclusive value creation: Measures are taken to provide every manufacturing worker with new opportunities and to support companies of all sizes, regional governments and local communities in strengthening companies’ competitiveness.

Creating value for all stakeholders: Innovative business models must ensure that value and growth are created for all stakeholders of a company, such as shareholders and employees and their local business ecosystem, including customers, suppliers and government agencies, among others. Leveraging innovation and technology adoption are important to driving this transformation. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Provide clarity. Clear values must be established for all stakeholders when launching new initiatives or adopting new technologies. 
– Learn about the different stages of business model transformation. Strategies for each stage exist and the board should ask key questions to ensure a smooth transition towards more digitalized business models.
– Join the cross-company accelerator. This accelerator, launched by the World Economic Forum New Business Models enabled by Advanced Manufacturing initiative, aims to deliver interactions where organizations share their own business model transformation journey.

Building resilient value chains: Resilience must become a core part of supply chain strategies. Most legacy manufacturing and value chains have undertaken significant upgrades to cope with unprecedented consumer needs and demand volatility, increasingly complex regulations and heightened expectations on tracking the impact of sustainability. This has in turn increased their reliance on complex digital systems – which can themselves face significant reliability issues and cybersecurity threats. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Explore distinct resilience profiles and identify best practices. The World Economic Forum White Paper, “Charting the Course for Global Value Chain Resilience”, presents five distinct profiles of resilience leadership to help companies in the manufacturing and supply chain ecosystem confidently chart a course towards resilience with focus and action and to manage supply chain disruptions.
– Assess the value chain resilience level. Organizations can use the resiliency compass, a new framework for them to accelerate the resilience-building process and define the new priorities and actions needed to prepare for and respond to future disruption.
– Consider resilience impacts when implementing new systems. The resilience of value chains must be considered a key metric when making investment decisions, keeping both its positive and negative effects in mind.

Leveraging technology adoption: Companies cannot solely focus on technology implementation; importantly, they must also concentrate on its comprehensive adoption by their organization at all levels and in all functions and geographies. This requires significant adjustments to the work culture, organization and work processes while considering local circumstances. Defining clear standards for excellence helps bring clarity and focus to the criteria for successful adoption, and sharing successful implementations and lessons learned can empower entire ecosystems to progress further. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Become a global lighthouse. Companies can submit a production site to be assessed and designated as a “Global Lighthouse” to showcase and share the experience.
– Assess the readiness for introducing new technologies. Companies can also use and adopt the Smart Industry Readiness Index.

Working towards human-centric production: As the level of advanced manufacturing on the shop floor increases, a broader range of skills – some of which are entirely new – becomes paramount to the success of manufacturing businesses. It is thus important that companies identify and develop the right skill set today to ensure success in the future. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Develop the right skill set. The workforce must be enabled to participate in the modern manufacturing environment and interact with digitalized systems, enhancing their strengths and addressing their challenges for a more inclusive environment. Both retraining and increasing technical skills are important building blocks to achieve this.
– Nurture future leaders. Manufacturing businesses should focus on nurturing future leaders with the right mindset to address global challenges. 
– Join the New Generation Industry Leaders group. This Forum community comprises rising industry leaders working to design and drive a responsible industry transformation.
– Champion workforce augmentation. Companies can appoint an executive with responsibilities at the intersection of people, operations and technology deployment to champion workforce augmentation initiatives within the organization.
– Share use cases and success stories. Manufacturing businesses could share successful cases of workforce augmentation in the production ecosystem with industry pioneers, thought leaders, policy-makers and labour unions.

Developing sustainable manufacturing systems: Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Adapt the business strategy. The core of the business strategy should incorporate sustainability, circularity and net-negative carbon impact. This should be communicated throughout the organization.
– Internalize sustainability in the organization. An executive should be appointed for sharing best practices and engaging in cross-company dialogue about successful sustainability initiatives and implementation.

Unlocking data and value of data sharing: Data are one of the most valuable digital assets that serve businesses, consumers and employees. Ensuring that data are captured, processed and activated in an accurate and timely way is paramount to maintaining trust in the digital ecosystem. Sophisticated applications often require the exchange of data beyond company boundaries to effectively train AI algorithms and to support collaboration in complex networks that require full transparency.200 It is also imperative to ensure a responsible use of data and to be aware of potential biases when training algorithms and AI. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Apply the Manufacturing Data Excellence framework. The framework can help gain actionable insights on the data maturity of the organization.
– Join a community of senior executives. Such a community provides the opportunity to discuss the change journey of becoming a datadriven organization.

Agile governance: Agile governance helps ensure that emerging technologies can be harnessed for social progress, while supporting responsible and equitable transitions to the digital future.
Traditional institutions and regulatory processes have lagged in adapting and responding to the technological advances that drive economic and social changes. Agile governance approaches seek to reform regulation and bridge divides by generating new approaches to policy-making that can unleash innovation while creating effective regulatory frameworks and better governance outcomes. To support innovative ecosystems, agile governance will increasingly be influenced by these trends: 
– Disruptive technologies. As a driver of agility and an enabler of dynamic regulatory systems, technological disruption will continue to spur adaptive policy systems that can keep pace with digital advances. 
– Complex public-private relationships. The real and digital worlds are increasingly connected. As social media, banks, healthcare, education and other fields integrate online, the relationships between businesses, governments and citizens will become more complex. 
– Proactive business risk management. Business and government must account for more risks alongside growing social and environmental challenges. Mechanisms of traditional governance have been slow to respond, resulting in businesses voluntarily adopting social responsibility measures, such as reporting on ESG metrics. 
Such trends require agility to keep pace with the velocity of change in intricate systems, and governance frameworks to ensure governments maintain control over regulatory and policy systems. Combined, agile governance helps ensure that emerging technologies can be harnessed for social progress while supporting responsible and equitable transitions into the digital future. 

Agile governance represents a fundamental shift in policy-making. To enable this shift, three actions for change are needed: 
Harmonizing boundaries between the public and private sectors: Governance can no longer be a one-way channel from government to business. A more transparent and collaborative process can steer innovation, safeguard markets and protect consumers, all without unduly curtailing advancement or burdening the private sector. 
Harmonizing boundaries will require Governments to: 
– Put consumers and businesses at the centre of the process of policy development
– Work across departments and authorities to coordinate supervision of the private sector 
– Innovate their policy-making process 
Harmonizing boundaries will require Businesses to: 
– Engage policy-makers and other industry stakeholders proactively 
– Be open about their needs and objectives to help governments stay on top of the landscape 
– Invest in education and capacity building to make new technologies more accessible 
Redefining public-private relationships is essential. Without removing boundaries, implementing collaborative risk-sharing models can help avoid conflicts of interest while harmonizing exchange between government and business.

Developing the tools and technology: Agile governance strives to improve the regulation and governance of technology. It involves the development of governance frameworks, policies and regulations that better manage emerging technologies and are resilient to further technological disruption. Many of the existing agile governance tools are only just starting to mature after being tested, refined and redeployed using identified best practices. Agile governance has evolved with the parallel imperative of using technology to deliver optimal regulatory and governance outcomes. The systematization of technologies can unlock regulatory potential. An expanding field of deploying regulatory technologies, known as “regtech”, leverages emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory processes. However, as businesses increasingly take ownership of their social and economic responsibilities through proactive risk management, it is also important to consider how technology will support agile-based structures like self-regulation or industry self-governance.

Building demand and capacity: Agile methods can help government and business overcome structural disadvantages that impede fast-paced decision-making and adoption. For government, challenges include complex bureaucratic processes and departmental silos. For business, complex legislation, high monitoring and reporting costs, and regulatory uncertainty are significant hurdles. Greater awareness is about how agile techniques provide value. Examples include sandboxes, machine-coded regulation and performancebased regulation – from facilitating the birth of new industries and delivering social services to managing environmental activities. Furthermore, capacity building is vital to create broader understandings of agile principles, such as human-centred design and experimentation, and to enhance personal abilities to create more agile leaders. It empowers policy-makers with the right knowledge and tools to facilitate their governance of technology and their use of technology to govern. It also empowers businesses to iteratively improve and adapt their innovations to meet market demands and deploy technologies responsibly.

Establishing scale: For agile governance to scale beyond specific use cases, pilots and champions, an environment must exist where businesses and policy-makers can embrace collaboration, experimentation and usercentred design. Strategies for putting this pathway to use include: 
– Foster agile leadership. Leaders can encourage others to embrace new methods of policy-making by sharing the achievements of agile governance. The Agile 50 list, an initiative by Apolitical and the World Economic Forum Global Future Council on Agile Governance, shares the contributions of such leaders. 
– Establish designated innovation fields. Fostering experimentation is important to shifting from a “set-and-forget” to a “test-and learn” mindset. Programmes such as the Dubai Programme to Enable Drone Transportation, and designated physical experimentation fields, help foster innovation beyond in a safe space. 
– Share agile governance techniques and best practice. As an evolving area, it is important to invest in understanding how best to employ and deploy agile governance. The Global Future Council on Agile Governance is developing a set of modules to help business leaders and policymakers feel confident in using agile governance. 
– Evolve from sandbox to scalebox. While small-scale experimentation (e.g. sandboxes) has proven fruitful for policy development, it tends to involve a small number of market actors. The next stage is to establish “scaleboxes” – as recommended by the Kalifa Review of U.K. Fintech – where experimentation can occur in the market with consumers and focus on growth.

Integrating partnership models: Multistakeholder collaboration is at the core of agile governance. It is critical to engage all relevant stakeholders – from developers and users to regulators – to foster knowledge exchange for the most optimal outcomes. These partnerships are tools for deploying agile governance. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Joined-up regulation. Emerging technologies can be managed using a “whole-of-government” approach that promotes coordination across regulators to streamline processes and drive consistency, especially for industries that may report to several authorities. 
– New public-private partnerships. Publicprivate partnerships are evolving by incorporating increased risk sharing, data sharing and insight sharing, moving from consultation to joint efforts to shape responsible technology ecosystems. These partnerships exist along the spectrum from communities involved in early-stage innovation to larger companies. 
– International regulatory cooperation. Digital technologies know no borders. Governments should collaborate internationally on regulating innovation by sharing knowledge and pooling resources. The Agile Nations, of which the World Economic Forum is an observer, seeks to drive intergovernmental regulatory cooperation.

Designing digital-ready policies: Digital-ready policies are created with digital developments in mind to ensure they are futureproof and equipped to deal with the impact of technological advances and digitalization. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Assess the readiness. Existing and new rules must be reviewed to determine whether they can be implemented using the latest technologies. 
– Scan the horizon for future trends. Recent developments should be considered to extrapolate how they may evolve. For example, what would make policies ready to manage the metaverse? 
– Expand capacity of policy-making institutions. At a minimum, relevant stakeholders must understand current technology and take advantage of new technological capabilities in their policy-making methodology.

Deploying technology in support of regulation: Regulation and reporting represent a large investment for businesses. Emerging technologies hold significant potential to improve regulatory processes, but they are currently underused. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Invest in regtech. The Global Future Council on Agile Governance is developing use cases and a roadmap for using regtech to improve processes for heavily regulated industries. This will help governments and business to understand why and how they can apply emerging technologies to regulation, for example through machinereadable code or natural-language processing.
– Foster government-driven consistency. Even when governments do not have a direct regulatory role, they can foster consistency and clarity for voluntary mechanisms. This includes enhancing public risk management and government frameworks, as well as providing public data (see “Reuse data”). For example, government-driven consistency in ESG reporting can help limit the potential of greenwashing. 
– Reuse data. Instead of business needing to establish duplicative data collection and measurement for compulsory and voluntary regulation, authorities can enable business to use public databases (with appropriate safeguards) to help shape digital governance. This can decrease ambiguity and increase consistency of reporting with comparable and verifiable data.

Artificial intelligence for humanity: Equity and inclusion must be addressed throughout the AI life cycle. 
In response to the growing backlash against harmful applications of AI systems, industries, governments, academics and civil society representatives have created numerous resources to encourage the responsible development and use of AI across sectors and geographies. While the long-term impact of AI – especially on marginalized groups – is yet unknown, engagement in design and policy development is largely absent in communities most directly affected by automation and other AI applications. A new blueprint for conceptual design, programmatic development and governance of AI is needed to include diverse perspectives at the table and mitigate risk of harm in deployment. 
Three areas to address include: 
– Skills and knowledge gaps. Underrepresented groups receive less information about AI, creating a barrier to entry for advanced degrees, jobs, and economic growth. 
– Entrenched bias. AI systems and related public policy designed by homogeneous groups fail to account for adverse impacts of the technology’s use in the broader world. 
– Rapid digital transformation. Companies adopt strategies without proper governance of training, testing and deployment to promote safe, equitable and inclusive practices. 
Equity and inclusion must be addressed in every corner of the AI life cycle to ensure that the development and use of AI technologies serve all of society.

Increasing representation: Given the reach of AI, it is critical to ensure individuals and communities have a basic understanding of AI, are protected from algorithmic bias, and are able to benefit from AI’s myriad benefits. A more representative AI ecosystem will prioritize responsible technology, demystify AI and harness innovation to contribute to a more equitable world. 
Access to knowledge: 
– Governments should mandate accessible AI/ tech literacy programmes in diverse languages for all citizens, with greater attention on more heavily affected communities. 
– Companies should offer mentorship and continuous skills development programmes. 
– Society should gain greater awareness of potential harm, and understanding of when and how AI is used. 
Equity and diversity at the decision-making level:
– The global South should be recognized as having an equitable stake in the design, development and financial return of AI. 
– Decision-making bodies should be diverse in composition and implement best practices in inclusion throughout the AI life cycle. 
Opportunities for consultation:
– Design, development and use should involve all stakeholders, especially women, girls, people of colour, persons with disabilities, displaced populations and other underrepresented groups.
 
Ensuring equitable outcomes: Given the potential for AI systems to affect all lives, it is critical that these systems employ fair processes and produce equitable outcomes. This can be supported by appropriate training, business practices, regulations and tools, such as comprehensive impact assessments of proposed systems. 
Technical solutions for bias and fairness:
– Ensure that explainability, transparency, robustness, bias and fairness principles are integrated into programming standards, protocols, logic and encryption. 
– Ensure cloud platforms and stacks are upgraded appropriately to address bias and fairness. – Define success and measure progress through specific key performance indicators (KPIs). 
Holistic approaches to promoting fairness: 
– Ensure equitable access to infrastructure. 
– Ensure that data are produced and code is signed by impacted communities. 
– Obtain informed consent from users of the AI systems, and make options for redress and debate available. 

Deploying AI benefits for all stakeholders: What is considered beneficial in one community may be considered harmful in another. Seemingly innocuous pieces of personal information in AI applications can be damaging if used for misinformation campaigns or government control of citizens. It is crucial that the provision of data or use of AI is made explicit along with a technology’s proposed benefit. Companies should enable users to opt out of an AI system if its proposed benefit is not valued by users, or if potential harms are seen to outweigh benefits. 
AI is developed and used with a beneficial purpose in mind:
– Socially beneficial use cases are clear. 
– Indigenous governance, traditional knowledge and perspectives of marginalized groups are integrated into organizational and technological decision-making. – Alternative options are available to stakeholders who prefer to opt out of AI use. 

Benefits of AI are known, accessible and shared across social groups: 
– Benefits of AI are clearly articulated to stakeholders. 
– Stakeholders have access to AI social entrepreneurship programmes. 

AI is beneficial even to groups without a voice: 
– AI development prioritizes a transgenerational focus to benefit and not harm youth or future generations, in alignment with human rights and the SDGs. 
– AI’s effect on the environment is measured and minimized. 

Breaking linguistic barriers: Most of the information on emerging technologies is written in English, which creates a barrier of entry to AI jobs and monocultural AI products and policy, both of which serve to limit the beneficial opportunities of the technology. 
Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Place linguistic diversity at the core of AI strategy. As access to knowledge depends on language, give precedence to non-English educational opportunities as the foundation of national or corporate AI strategies, and provide more visual messaging. 
– Enable shared vocabulary across stakeholders. Encourage interaction and collaboration across developers, business teams, civil society and consumers to ensure the entire AI ecosystem uses a shared vocabulary. 
– Improve technical capabilities in various languages of AI technologies. Leverage and expand on technological advances in translation through expanded training sets and funding of AI-based text recognition in new languages. 

Expanding education and training opportunities: AI impacts everyone, yet few specialists have the requisite knowledge and training. Education systems, public entities and businesses must promote the acquisition of skills and competencies required for an AI-powered society. This will stimulate innovation and new ways of seeing, valuing and using AI. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Embrace a holistic approach. Formal and informal educational communities integrate AI learning, regardless of school, company or socioeconomic status, in culturally appropriate ways. 
– Make AI education engaging. Straightforward, exciting and engaging education, integrated into arts and humanities pedagogy, will contribute greatly to increasing diversity in the AI ecosystem. 
– Implement role-specific training on AI fairness. Employees in all departments should receive basic information on what AI is, what it can and cannot do, and how they can influence outcomes. The World Economic Forum White Paper entitled “A Holistic Guide to Approaching AI Fairness Education in Organizations” offers recommendations on how to implement this. 
– Reach the public sector. Supporting education improvements in the public sector is essential to ensure good AI governance and the implementation of responsible AI policies. 
– Apply a systems-thinking approach. The potential unintended consequences of AI technologies should be mapped out, moving away from a transactional view that positions businesses and innovators at the centre of technology agendas, conversations and development. 
– Encourage continuous learning. AI education is accessible and encouraged from grade school through professional education in a range of formats, including certifications. 

Building vital AI infrastructure: Private- and public-sector actors must co-develop critical infrastructure, from data storage to fora for dialogue with diverse sectors. This foundation will enable nations currently lagging in AI maturity to leapfrog ahead, both in their economy as well as their efforts in governance. It would also offer companies universal consumer engagement to help shape and improve AI systems. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Prioritize the set-up of AI infrastructure to fully deliver impact to all communities. National governments, together with cloud providers and chipset companies, lead on infrastructure and data training projects to facilitate communities receiving the benefits of AI. This will be particularly crucial in countries lacking robust electronic data storage, where additional resources will be needed to transmit information from paper to digital storage. 
– Establish feedback channels for impacted stakeholders. Creating opportunities for increased communication between AI creators and consumers will be important, as will communicating ways in which feedback has resulted in changes to the AI system. It is also important to empower facilitating organizations (e.g. consumer groups) and to offer opportunities for redress. 
– Empower the participation of stakeholders in decision-making. Rather than passive community participation as currently employed (often part of user experience [UX] testing), an “inclusive by design” methodology should be embraced. Impact assessment tools should be deployed wherever possible and an agile approach to feedback adopted, including via social media.

Media, entertainment and sport: With almost 4 billion users consuming media, entertainment and sports content daily, these sectors have enormous potential to influence people’s perspectives and livelihoods. Several trends are accelerating the media industry’s role in shaping the world: 

– Digital safety. Harmful content, conduct and contact have proliferated online and pose huge risks to all internet users, particularly vulnerable groups such as children. Social platforms have made it easier to create and distribute all types of information, but this has also resulted in harmful and illegal content. 
– DE&I. The decisions people make about how they create content, whose stories they share and what narratives and perceptions they shape will have a lasting impact on society. Advancing DE&I in media and entertainment is crucial to creating a more equitable, just society
– Metaverse. The metaverse refers to a set of concepts and trends that, some experts believe, represent the next major computing platform. Central to the idea is extended reality (XR), defined as “a combination of augmented, virtual and mixed reality environments that are accessible and interactive in real time”.207 When combined with blockchain applications, XR could blend the physical and digital worlds to increasing degrees, enabling new forms of social and commercial interaction, creativity and value creation. This hybrid environment – the metaverse – may eventually become an extension of the real-world economy, transforming consumer experiences and business models across industries.

Advancing digital safety: Mechanisms and tools for public-private cooperation: 
– Stakeholders define harmful content differently; areas such as hate speech, sexual exploitation and misinformation are not understood uniformly across platforms and national jurisdictions. 
– Regulators, companies and other stakeholders need to productively tackle these challenges in a collaborative way and address underlying safety tensions and trade-offs. 
Industry accountability and effective regulation: 
– Industry accountability and oversight are currently lacking: no comprehensive third-party auditing processes and practices to evaluate accuracy or the effectiveness of content moderation practices and policy enforcement exist. 
– Regulatory schemes are no longer fragmented national approaches that increase cost, complexity and uncertainty for businesses, especially smaller players. Alignment on a global or multi-jurisdictional regulatory framework has significantly helped in this regard. 
Safety principles to guide trade-offs, interventions and measures: 
– Alignment on common digital safety principles is fundamental to shape policies and processes for balancing safety, privacy, free expression and security online as well as delineating responsibilities between the public and private sectors. 
– There is an agreed upon risk-based framework for the optimal use of interventions, such as content removal and account suspensions. 
– An industry-wide accepted measure of user safety on digital platforms exists. 

Ensuring diversity, equity and inclusion in media: 
Accurate portrayals in content: 
– In-content diversity is directly seen, heard or experienced by the audience. Measurements may focus on the number of diverse characters and their time on-screen, or portrayals or the stereotypes that are challenged or perpetuated. 
– Diverse characters and fair portrayals allow audiences to hear their stories being told in an authentic manner. Ads, games, videos and other forms of media can have harmful unintended consequences when they portray groups in a certain way or reinforce stereotypes. 
Diversity and representation in creative roles: 
– Creative diversity is vital to creating content that reflects the lived experiences of diverse audiences. It is important to assess who is creating the content, who is greenlighting it, and what cultures exist around that content to meaningfully measure how the output reflects its audiences. 
Measurement and transparency: 
– This requires the ability to measure DE&I impact based upon data and transparency from organizations. An objective and neutral service to measure the state of diversity in the industry is critical for benchmarking and assessing success and opportunities for improvement. 
– Audience sentiment is an effective metric for successful representation as it can be influenced and assessed quickly. 

Governance and value creation in the metaverse: Several fundamental technologies come together in an integrated, interoperable and inclusive way, transforming consumer experiences, value creation and business models across industries. 
The World Economic Forum Global Future Council on Media, Entertainment and Sport supports efforts in two areas: 
– The governance of extended reality (XR). This involves working on policy frameworks for XR systems; promoting equity, inclusion and accessibility; ensuring economic opportunity and interoperability while preserving user privacy; and reducing potential harms in immersive environments. 
– Value creation in the metaverse. This involves defining how assets are designed, advertised, marketed and sold; mapping value chains, IP and investment models and trends influencing the landscape; realizing the potential of the creator economy; identifying incentives and risks in developing the metaverse; and analysing the metaverse’s impact on society and culture. 

Harnessing public-private cooperation to advance digital safety: Advancing public-private cooperation on tackling harmful activity online will be critical as current measures do not effectively attribute accountability to the relevant players in the ecosystem. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Join the Global Coalition for Digital Safety. This coalition aims to “accelerate public-private cooperation to tackle harmful content online and exchange best practices for new online safety regulation, take coordinated action to reduce the risk of online harms, and drive collaboration on programmes to enhance digital media literacy”. The coalition is working towards: 
1. A global charter of principles for digital safety: Designing underlying principles and responsibilities for governing digital safety across the public and private sectors, guiding decision-making that requires balancing privacy, safety and security 
2. A toolkit for digital safety interventions: Exploring digital safety interventions as well as preventative measures across the public and private sectors; outlining appropriate usage based on various risk factors 
3. New measures and standards for protecting vulnerable groups online: Identifying mechanisms that are particularly used to target vulnerable groups, and drive international standards in addressing these successfully; outlining more effective measures to assess how safe users are on a given product or service, particularly given that current measures do not capture outsized harm to vulnerable groups.
 
– Ensure digital safety and protection by design in the metaverse/Web3. As the exploration of how to operate safely in the metaverse progresses, it will be imperative to consider digital safety components from the outset to create safe online spaces and avoid replication of existing safety limitations in Web2 and social media. 

Improving diversity and representation in content and creative production: Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Join the Power of Media taskforce and follow guidance for improving measurement, transparency and accountability. Diversity data from companies can be aggregated and published to create a sense of urgency and internal pressure for other organizations. The companies that voluntarily report their diversity data can gain the trust and favour of consumers and investors. A common set of metrics and goals across sectors can help to hold all players accountable. It is widely agreed by the taskforce that audience sentiment and demographics can be prominent measures of the DE&I footprint. The taskforce has developed a Diversity Representation Maturity framework to instil a clear, well-defined structure around the components that constitute effective diversity and inclusion in the media and entertainment industries. 
– Use the cross-sector index. Building on the Diversity Representation Maturity framework, a cross-sector index that measures audience sentiment and demographics can be used to compare the attitudes and behaviours of diverse identity groups. This index will help to enable the adoption of best practices and develop insights into where progress is lacking. Refreshing it periodically could illustrate the collective progress and impact by sector. The first Audience Representation Index serves as a baseline for the industry to better measure and advance the state of diversity and inclusion. 
– Prioritize inclusivity in the metaverse. The generation leading the growth on the metaverse will not tolerate non-inclusive creative content. Intentionality, transparency and accountability are critical to truly represent audiences and empower creators in the metaverse. The optimism on DE&I needs to be acknowledged to create an inclusive environment in the metaverse, where organizations will need to lead by example to create an equitable future enabled by technology and innovation.

Quantum computing: The path to scalable, commercial quantum computers will become increasingly clear in the next five years.
The potential of quantum science and technology could be as transformative as semiconductors in the 20th century, with massive economic impact in sectors ranging from information and communications technology to healthcare, for example. The technology is in its early stages, with many options for underlying platforms. Due to this emerging state, the road ahead is uncertain. Three key trends are bound to drive the rapid change and require action from the international community: 
– Rapid growth in venture financing and large public (state) investments. This will lead to high expectations, strong competition for talent, and economic and geopolitical policy interventions. 
– Growing quantum ecosystems. University affiliated ecosystems will continue to drive hardware, software and application development. 
– Emerging market for first-generation noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. This is driven by early adoption and experimentation across the public sector and industries. 

The path to a scalable and commercial quantum computer will become increasingly clear in the next five years. Many system improvements are expected, including a sizeable increase in the number of qubits and better error-correction techniques. Algorithms for use cases are under development for hybrid quantum-classical systems, and numerous tools for the supporting quantum infrastructure stack are emerging. As quantum computing holds potential to redefine power structures, the international community should act now to guide it in a responsible way rather than exacerbate geopolitical tensions.

Developing commercial applications and quantum solutions: A bold vision for 2025 includes a clear pathway towards a viable demonstration of quantum advantage, wherein a quantum computer solves an application of interest cheaper, faster or more accurately than a classical computer. The first demonstrations of potential quantum-computerenabled results that are beyond the capabilities of the highest-performing classical computers will be achieved. A pathway towards a proof-of-concept contributing quantum computing solutions to global problems – for example, modelling climate change or finding new materials to use in the energy transition – leads to a future where quantum computing will become a necessary part of all computing frameworks. To achieve this, the availability of the relevant algorithms as well as the necessary near-term quantum hardware and supporting classical infrastructure, is required. At that time, end users will be positioned to scale the achieved proofs of concept(s) and further reinvest to enable other demonstrations. 

Reaching the quantum advantage through a trusted ecosystem and community: In this vision, international tension related to critical technologies exists due to economic competition and geopolitical manoeuvres that undermine fair and open competition. A growing consensus emerges that quantum computing will create value as progress continues to shift from basic research to commercial developments in established companies and new start-ups. The Vision 2025 is to create an open, trustworthy and fair global marketplace that provides an ecosystem for robust competition for both the development and use of quantum computers.
This means all governments, companies and individuals are treated fairly and equally while protecting the intellectual property (IP) of all parties. In turn, it requires a robust supply chain for components, as well as competitive and accessible (open-source) software with clear standards and benchmarks so that competing hardware and software can be meaningfully compared. This could include as diverse a set as materials, equipment for fabrication, the key quantum components, control electronics and cryogenic equipment, and software layers and algorithms. To enable this, a coalition of like-minded countries signs a “Quantum Act” with a governing framework for collaborative research and development, export controls, talent development and exchange, with the necessary funds and organization to support implementation. The goal is broad trade agreements between nation states and international markets that foster trust, transparency and equity and that encourage technology access for countries of all economic statuses. Specific roadblocks that prevent international collaboration and the free flow of ideas and scientific know-how should be overcome. 

Defining common ethical standards on the use of quantum computing: The transformative potential of quantum computers accelerates the need to anticipate and define common ethical standards that will frame the future use of these machines. This is foreseen as a key area of work for the next several years. Before 2025, representatives from the quantum computing industry, research organizations and different governments meet and reflect on the core ethical foundations of the technology. A constructive dialogue leads to regional and even international consensus on ethical use principles, such as accessibility, equality, inclusiveness, transparency, accountability and the common good. Consensus also extends to inappropriate use made possible by the future use of quantum computers.

Increasing the number of quantum learners: To meet the needs of the growing quantum computing industry and accompanying basic research, a larger workforce is necessary worldwide. This requires training a new cohort of quantum specialists, including current professionals and future graduates. Efforts should be made to encourage diversity and inclusion. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Equip the current workforce. This involves fostering open science and exchange programmes and establishing dedicated training programmes to teach the current workforce about standards, benchmarking and new areas of the field. 
– Educate the future workforce. Efforts to expand education include increasing the number of undergraduate and graduate programmes offering courses in quantum computing, as well as introducing quantum computing basics in secondary education. 
– Attract a broad and diverse workforce. Vital to ensuring fair, excellent quantum products and services that cater to global communities, this can be achieved with outreach programmes in secondary and post-secondary education, online platforms and courses that can reach a global and diverse audience. Targeted initiatives to increase diversity (especially gender) and inclusiveness can also be part of this strategy. 

Investing strategically for optimal growth: To support a sustainable framework for growth in quantum computing globally, resources and activities from public- and private-sector entities must be optimally aligned. A reliable overview of the global technology landscape, as well as the coordination of public- and private-sector investment and activities, can lead to more efficient resource allocation and an acceleration of the technology and its use. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Monitor the global technology landscape. Neutral positional papers (“State of Quantum report”) should be produced that document existing global national quantum investment strategies as well as industry development roadmaps, and identify opportunities for optimal future investments. 
– Align investment strategies. Public- and private-sector investments should be balanced by allocating government funding in broad infrastructure projects, long-term research and overarching societal use cases. 
– Foster cooperation between the public and private sectors. Public- and privatesector actors can increase their interactions, as academia and national labs bolster private industry development and pave the way for future ideas and innovations. This also helps enable a cohesive and collaborative global ecosystem with room for protecting IP. 

Establishing a framework for international collaboration: To help global industry and markets develop and support common goals and values, it is imperative to start building the framework and governing principles for this market now. A balance is required between open science, the free flow of talent and ideas, and the protection of shared values, such as respect for IP arrangements and responsible use of technology. To this end, existing bodies, such as standardization groups, will need to consider quantum computing as part of their mission, and new frameworks will need to be established to guide the development of quantum computing systems. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Establish a trusted community. A group of experts from academia, industry and government should be convened to serve as the initiators of the trusted community. This group should implement tangible actions that accelerate the trusted community, such as membership models and screening procedures for investors and companies. 
– Establish an international coordinating body. It should involve all major ecosystems and initiate the actions needed, with a special effort to include less advantaged countries and societies. 
– Create internationally accepted standards and benchmarks. This will help to foster transparency over the efficiency of available hardware and software solutions. 

Developing open-source resources for standards and software: To appropriately enable an ecosystem to harness quantum advantage in a fair and ethical way, it is critical that parts of the quantum computing stack are developed in open source. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Create open access to quantum systems over the cloud. Resource estimation for applications of interest should be transparent, and open-source software communities need to help ensure equitable access and learning in quantum computing. Many existing open-source projects in this space can be developed further. 
– Stimulate the development of open-source quantum computing tools and software. Open-source software communities can help ensure equitable access and learning in quantum computing. 
– Safeguard open science. A diverse and global community of researchers should be maintained to build and investigate underpinning science, technology and applications of quantum computing.

Scientific collaboration: Global scientific collaboration is necessary to tackle global challenges, from climate change to health.
The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates once more that global scientific collaboration is necessary to tackle global challenges, from climate change to health. Innovative solutions require contributions from a diverse array of countries, disciplines, sectors and backgrounds to ensure access to the best talent, knowledge and data available, and to a variety of perspectives. Three trends in scientific collaboration stand out: 
– COVID-19. The pandemic has disrupted many aspects of research. As the world establishes a “new normal”, there is an opportunity to decide which changes may improve the research system. The pandemic also provides lessons for dealing with other shared global challenges, like global warming and cybersecurity. – Retreat from multilateralism. Reduced collaboration between countries impedes collaboration between their scientists.
Some barriers are put in place deliberately by governments to prevent contact with people from other countries. Some are by coincidence, such as reduced mobility due to closed borders. All make it more difficult for scientists to collaborate internationally. 
– Balancing fundamental and mission-driven research. Most countries increasingly prioritize mission-driven applied research. This favours research focused on specific goals, such as developing a COVID-19 vaccine, at the expense of open-ended, curiosity-driven basic research that generates the fundamental knowledge to fuel future mission-driven research. 
Approaches to these and other trends will shape scientific progress for decades to come. They will affect the type, quality and amount of knowledge produced, who gets trained to produce it, the level of technological innovation and, ultimately, humanity’s ability to respond to future global crises.

Ensuring scientific infrastructure and funding: Science is a public good that relies to a large extent on public investments in research to run laboratories and train the next generation of researchers. Scientists gravitate towards research for which funding and infrastructure are available, making the development of scientific infrastructure and the availability of funding two of the most direct ways to influence the direction of scientific research. A proper balance between funding for mission-driven and for fundamental research ensures both short-term and long-term scientific and technological progress. International collaborations currently face high barriers to success, as most countries focus on funding domestic research initiatives. A multilateral approach to scientific funding enables larger, more ambitious projects that no single country can accomplish alone. The economic fallout of COVID-19 and reduced multilateral collaboration may spur governments to cut funding for international scientific collaborations and projects. These decisions will jeopardize scientific progress, preparedness for future global crises and the scientific diplomacy which arises from international collaborations. 

Disseminating knowledge: In order to collaborate, scientists must be able to easily share their findings and data. While scientists have traditionally shared knowledge with one another through peer-reviewed journal articles, high subscription fees make most of the journals inaccessible to scientists in lower-income countries. Open science is therefore a crucial tool to ensure scientific progress across the world and thus reduce inequalities. Several platforms exist to circumvent these limitations: 
– Open-access journals make their articles freely available to readers without a subscription; researchers or their institutions, however, must pay to publish in them. 
– Pre-print servers allow free publishing and access to papers but without pre-publication vetting, leaving it to the reader to evaluate a paper’s quality. – Open data repositories allow the direct sharing of data. A lack of standards for these repositories, though, means that their quality varies widely, and that data cannot easily be shared across different platforms. 

Promoting scientific communication and literacy: Effective and transparent communication of scientific findings, from public lectures to Wikipedia edit-a-thons, can improve collaboration between scientists and make science accessible to the public. This brings new perspectives to scientific endeavours, allowing for thinking that more directly addresses the needs of the wider community, from citizen science initiatives to industrial partnerships. On the other hand, poor scientific communication can contribute to misinformation and reduce trust in science. Developing scientific literacy, through both the education system and interactions between scientists and the public, can help promote trust in and support for science, and collaboration across sectors and borders. 

Ensuring academic freedom and integrity: Academic freedom and integrity are integral to the pursuit of scientific research. It is not possible to conduct productive collaborative work where partners may lack the full right to freedom of speech and opinion. The COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to cases where public health measures were hindered by national pressure. Climate change also provides examples where restrictions preventing government scientists from talking about climate science slowed action. 

Targeting scientific funding to support collaboration: Public-and private-sector funders, together with government, must collaborate to develop a strategy to support both domestic and international science. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Create a long-term strategy for scientific collaboration. Governments must work together to support international collaborative research in an enduring manner. This strategy should be designed to resist changes in governments and the political climate. Key elements include a plan to support durable access to and sharing of high-quality data and other scientific results, and infrastructure investments, such as international labs and research facilities enabling collaborative research in different disciplines. 
– Increase cooperation between governments and industry. Governments should promote the participation of industry in funding scientific collaborations. At the same time, scientific endeavours should be transparent and free from undesired industrial, economic, and political influence. Key areas that warrant attention include broad agreement on IP protection, regulatory oversight, and data privacy protection. 

Facilitating free movement of people and data: Some types of collaboration must take place in person, such as training personnel in teams or using specialized facilities. Even remote collaboration requires data sharing. This can be hindered by restrictions on sharing certain types of data, for-fee databases, or by lack of access to digital tools among some collaborators. Therefore, facilitating the free flow of people is essential for scientific collaboration. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Lift travel restrictions. Within the current context of managing the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions on international travel must be minimized. After the pandemic, all countries must ensure the free movement of researchers as a prerequisite for scientific collaboration. 
– Support open data. Removing legislative roadblocks to open data sharing and supporting the necessary infrastructure to ensure long-term access to data are essential for scientific collaboration. The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship211 could provide a framework for this pathway. 
– Harmonize data-sharing protocols. Where completely open access to data is not feasible, countries can harmonize protocols for data sharing so that scientists can access them in a timely manner, no matter their location. This necessitates building a culture of trust and responsibility among the institutions and governments sharing data, including mutuallyagreed arrangements on how countries can share data and IP. 

Improving public awareness of and trust in research findings: Research organizations and governmental institutions and industry must work together to support effective scientific communication with the public to foster trust and eradicate misinformation. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Protect the independence of scientific institutions. Collaboration between scientific and government institutions is important for addressing national and international challenges and for implementing sciencebased policies. Scientific institutions must have the necessary independence from governments, however, to promote scientific findings even when these do not support their government’s policies and to advocate for policies in line with scientific findings. This independence must be communicated to the public to avoid association of scientific institutions with a particular government and the resulting politicization of scientific findings and recommendations. 
– Increase diversity in scientific institutions. Increasing diversity – and particularly among decision-makers within those institutions – will bring a more diverse set of views to the table when making decisions about research strategies and the allocation of funds. This includes representation of groups historically under-represented in science, such as a balanced representation of genders, a wider array of ethnicities and nationalities, and diversity in other areas of life, such as age, career stage, physical disability and field of study. In medical science, increased female representation has led to more research into women’s health issues, improving the health of women and other people suffering from conditions like osteoporosis and migraines. 
– Support social science. Effectively translating scientific findings into the real world requires an understanding of the different social settings in which they will be applied. Science funders can promote this by supporting collaborations that include social scientists who have knowledge of and connections to the communities where scientific knowledge is being created and findings are being implemented.

Space: Accessing space for the benefit of the economy and society on Earth is easier than ever.
Space is facing accelerated change that is likely to persist through 2025 and bring significant benefits as well as challenges for humanity. New manufacturing approaches, streamlined assembly and reusability have lowered launch costs and spurred new rocket companies, providing greater choice and lower prices to access and use space. Mass-produced, affordable and smaller satellites can be launched to perform meaningful missions and provide new services. As a result, accessing space for the benefit of the economy and society on Earth is easier than ever. The key trends creating a more active and crowded space environment are: 
– High levels of private-sector funding and growing public-sector interest. Private-sector investment and public-sector support enable the buildout of significant infrastructure in space, including commercial alternatives to the International Space Station, on-orbit space services and missions to the Moon and cislunar space. 
– Geopolitics in outer space. Geopolitical rivalry is creating risk of conflict in orbit, posing enduring risks to the space environment. 
– Growing demand for global connectivity and Earth monitoring. Greater internet connectivity (particularly to underserved, remote areas) and the availability of Earth monitoring data are prompting the development of new satellite constellations, especially within Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This proliferation requires appropriate regulatory approaches to prevent harmful radiofrequency interference, guarantee the long-term sustainable use of Earth orbits and ensure security against cyberattacks. 
– Climate change. Earth monitoring data collected from satellites will become even more abundant and crucial to providing possible insights for the climate.

Addressing space traffic and debris: A more congested space environment means safe operations and a sustainable environment for future space development and operations must be ensured. The problem becomes more acute as debris from high-altitude, anti-satellite weapons tests further increases the risk of collisions in orbit, reducing the projected lifetime of satellites and negatively affecting space industry economics. Satellite innovation and large constellations intensify the need for jointly developed and widely adopted norms of operation for space traffic interactions between space actors around the world. This will entail active and good-faith coordination among governments and the commercial operators licenced by them: 
– Scientific and technical progress is needed to better characterize the orbital debris and enhance means to avoid collisions. 
– Improved implementation of existing guidelines is required, as well as new best practices, technical standards and economic incentives to allow clearing debris from old missions. 
– With easy access to capital, new opportunities exist for innovation in technology and techniques to improve the space environment. But there is also the risk that unsustainable business plans will be funded and that potential bankruptcies could create new challenges of managing and disposing of space assets. – Further research, coordination, data collection and sharing are also needed in the field of space weather and its impact on space assets. Finally, increased space activity has environmental consequences on Earth, including from accelerated launch cadence (burning of rocket fuel) and disposal of satellites (burning them in Earth’s atmosphere, the current practice of removing satellites from LEO). 

Coordinating space-based data to better tackle the climate crisis: Earth-sensing satellites enhance the understanding of earth science and the evolution of the planet’s climate, helping to measure relevant climate change indicators. Satellite measurements of air and sea surface temperatures and of sea levels, as well as other space-based observations, reveal important consequences of a warming planet. While satellites provide vital data, gaps remain in full understanding, modelling, mitigation, adaptation and coordination. Multiple organizations conduct research into relevant climate change processes, but there is not yet an organization dedicated to the continual and integrated development of this core modelling field – earth systems modelling – and to embedding results in a physical visualization environment that can inform and help shape decision-making. Beyond environment monitoring, space infrastructure plays a key role in supporting other ESG metrics. Data from space can help companies increase the efficiency of their operations and survey their overall supply chains.

Ensuring a space-for-space economy and space resources: Space resource mining on the Moon or asteroids, along with space-based solar power, represent longterm opportunities with potential to provide materials to construct space-based habitats and eventually to help address resource scarcity on Earth. A spacefor-space economy starts to emerge, with services such as space-based laser networks for inter-satellite and Earth connectivity, multiple space stations and habitats, in-orbit refuelling depots and advanced satellite servicing. To ensure sustainable and beneficial development, the character of outer space as a global commons domain must be respected. Current national political and regulatory approaches risk leading to disagreements among nation states and may result in either lower investments due to uncertainties or uncoordinated investments. 

Encouraging sustainable behaviour in space: Governmental and non-governmental actors must further collaborate to address orbital traffic and debris, as well as consider environmental consequences on Earth of increased space activity. With a lack of universally accepted and binding comprehensive principles and norms in a fastgrowing space economy in general, more is required to ensure safe operations and make space activities sustainable for future development and operations. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Establish metrics to measure the sustainability of space activities. The Space Sustainability Rating (SSR), developed by an international consortium of partners, is a voluntary framework to encourage and provide incentive to operators to behave responsibly in space by increasing the transparency of organizations’ space environmental sustainability and debris mitigation efforts.212 The SSR will provide a space mission score measuring efforts to maintain a sustainable space environment, including debris mitigation and alignment with international guidelines. From 2022, an organization can obtain a rating for their mission from the EPFL Space Center (eSpace) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
– Encourage implementation of international frameworks and best practices. Long-term sustainability guidelines were adopted by the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN-COPUOS) and the UN General Assembly and further work is ongoing, while the UN First Committee recently adopted a resolution on voluntary norms of behaviour. The International Institute of Space Law, the International Astronautical Federation and the International Academy of Astronautics joined in a trilateral, multidisciplinary effort to design a space traffic management approach. For the past 12 years, the Space Data Association, which convenes both public- and privatesector satellite operators, has operated global, coordinated operational data sharing, improved collision warnings, developed best practices and identified capabilities for the next generation of space traffic management systems. Additional global initiatives are needed to implement overarching frameworks that help manage the space environment. For example, the World Economic Forum Global Future Council on Space is preparing a concept for a space sustainability monitor (SSM), which is a tool to monitor, showcase and incentivize states’ implementation of international frameworks and best practices to promote the safety and sustainability of outer space activities. In addition to getting information about a state’s willingness to apply different standards and regulations, the SSM will also incorporate the notion of a space traffic footprint, which will further encourage national actors to promote sustainable use of space by measuring the number of objects (active and in-active) in orbit. 
– Incentivize operators to reduce orbital debris. “Net-zero” or debris reduction incentives, fee schemes, or escrow funds could help to reduce the creation of space debris. Also, penalties for littering and regulatory oversight for discouraging irresponsible behaviour and monopolistic business practices are needed. 

Supporting the collation, management and analysis of climate data: To harness the full potential of climate change data, its management, analysis and integration need to be improved. 
– Establish an agency that leverages space technology and operations to better support climate action. The Global Future Council on Space has developed a concept for an Earth Operations Centre (EOC), a facility to leverage space data and expertise to conduct multidisciplinary science and engineering research to monitor and provide insights to manage climate change. The creation of this facility, as well as of a “digital twin” of Earth – a dynamic, digital replica of the planet already being explored by the European Space Agency and other organizations – will provide a powerful symbol of the commitment to address these challenges today, and to serve as the Earth’s climate hub on behalf of future generations. 

Developing the space-for-space economy and harnessing space resources responsibly: The work of several organizations, such as the newly formed intergovernmental Working Group on Exploration, Exploitation and Utilization of Space Resources of the Legal Sub-committee of UN-COPUOS, or the non-governmental Hague International Space Resources Working Group, should be continued to further address and discuss the challenges of governance, technical safety and socio-economic benefits that will come with the development of a robust and sustainable space-for-space economy, including space resource extraction.
 
Synthetic biology: Synthetic biology develops tools and frameworks that enable the purposeful engineering of biology with greater precision, predictability, sophistication and speed.
Over 4 billion years, biology has evolved countless sustainable solutions, resulting in millions of species existing in ecosystems in harmony with planetary resources. People have learned new ways to interact with biology such that this inherent sustainability can be harnessed to develop new technologies that can benefit people and the planet. If employed thoughtfully and responsibly, synthetic biology applications can respond to the world’s social, environmental and economic needs, and help solve global challenges, including transitioning to a more sustainable future. Three key trends identified by the Global Future Council on Synthetic Biology are: 
– Growing bioeconomies. Advances in synthetic biology are enabling many valuable applications. Investment in bio-based technologies, industries and economies is growing rapidly, though activity remains concentrated in a few regions. 
– Emerging biostrategies. Countries, companies and other organizations around the world are focusing on advances in synthetic biology to help them recover from COVID-19 and to serve as an engine for new sustainable industries. 
– Platform-driven biosciences. Broadening biological data sets and powerful biological engineering tools are accelerating the scope and scale of what is possible in the biosciences. Those who steward data and technology platforms in bioscience have significant power in this revolution. 
The last two decades of synthetic biology have delivered new tools, approaches and communities. The challenge now is to develop the visions, pathways and partnerships that can realize the vast promise of benefits in the decades to come. 

Building a bioeconomy for everyone, everywhere: The potential benefits of synthetic biology are diverse, but they must be developed and distributed equitably. The vision for 2025 is that every country, including emerging and developing economies, has the capacity to build a bio-based circular economy, benefit from record investments and increase sustainability across sectors using synthetic biology. Every country can unlock new forms of value from their biodiversity; transition from polluting industries and practices to use more sustainable bio-based solutions across manufacturing, energy and beyond; and innovate for the health and well-being of local communities, including through new diagnostics, treatments and vaccines. 
To encourage and sustain this transition towards bio-based economies, nations and regions are launching mission-driven initiatives that embrace equitable forms of collaboration, consensusbuilding and governance to work together across sectoral and geographic boundaries alike. These initiatives demonstrate pragmatism and humility through a focus on understanding which challenges to prioritize, which of these challenges synthetic biology can usefully help address and which it cannot, and the timelines involved. 
The tools, technologies and data capabilities emerging from these initiatives are shaped by all members of society for the benefit of all people and the planet.213 This aspiration informs strategy, policy and practice at all levels, including in innovation and regulatory policy as well as investment and benefitsharing arrangements. 
Building these foundations involves recommitments from all people, organizations and nations to safeguard the shared biological future against potential misuse. By protecting against biological threats, society allows peaceful purposes to flourish and helps to advance towards a world in which everyone is entrusted and empowered to be a biological citizen. 

Safeguarding global commons and maximizing cooperation: Bioscience data and technology infrastructures comprise a valuable global commons and foster improved cooperation across borders and sectors. Industry, governments and civil society collectively recognize the increasing power inherent in ownership and control of these biological assets paired with the importance of developing and distributing these assets and capabilities equitably.
New public-private partnerships form to build shared knowledge repositories to enable global synthetic biology efforts. Shared digital sequence data and other knowledge commons help to fuel, shape and responsibly safeguard global synthetic biology efforts. Investments in the technical infrastructure for knowledge sharing are coupled to investments in the social infrastructure that guides and supports its development and use. Education, business development and policy engagement help drive leadership that connects technical, social and policy issues. Such efforts empower millions of new participants in synthetic biology research and technology development, boosting the likelihood that the real potential of global innovation can be harnessed, scaling advances in synthetic biology, decreasing costs and increasing access to biologically-derived products and services. 
In this future, cross-border and cross-sector collaborations are open, effective and, wherever possible, transparent. Working across geographies and ideologies, all people recognize that now is the time to collectively guide the trajectory of synthetic biology development to maximize positive impacts and safeguard shared biological futures. 

Embedding key values in bioeconomy strategies: If synthetic biology is to realize its potential to bring social, economic and environmental benefits, bioeconomy strategies and policies must be guided by values supporting and safeguarding all people and the planet. Harnessing the talent needed to respond to global challenges requires revisiting structures for resourcing and recognition. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Identify global challenges where synthetic biology could contribute to inclusive solutions. Centring collaborations on specific foci, including the SDGs, climate change and pandemic preparedness, could encourage sharing, comparing and collaborating. 
– Embed design thinking and a plurality of perspectives in bioeconomy strategy development. Broad and early engagement in strategy and policy development is essential to building values of equity, humility, sustainability and solidarity into the technology.It is also necessary to develop better metrics for value in innovation ecosystems and amplify underrepresented voices in bioeconomy narratives. 
– Develop legal and financial tools that deliver investment to enable vibrant bioeconomies globally. Financing arrangements that combine public- and private-sector financing to support social enterprises are needed. Risk assessment techniques should incentivize a broad range of projects focusing on pragmatic outcomes. Investment strategies should combine financial returns with measurable social impact. 

Strengthening all geographies of innovation: To reach the full potential of synthetic biology, the creativity and capability of the global research community must be leveraged, and the benefits of synthetic biology must be delivered globally. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Recognize and leverage strengths of geographic diversity. Value is derived from genetic resources and talent sourced worldwide, but innovation is concentrated in limited geographies. Greater benefit can be unlocked if local populations participate in discovery and development. The Global South is underrepresented and should be further drawn in both as developer and as beneficiary. Attracting, educating and developing people in developed countries is not enough: local innovation is essential to providing effective frameworks for solutions and ensuring local benefits. 
– Form equitable partnerships to enable geographic diffusion of synthetic biology. The products and services that emerge from synthetic biology should be responsive to societal and cultural differences. Partnerships need to be established with all innovation stakeholders, creating enabling conditions for the technology to flourish in both local and global contexts. 
– Increase local autonomy for research and innovation. Local autonomy requires reduced dependency on foreign funding, increased capacity building and reduced scientific dependency. This can be done by building a qualified workforce and infrastructure, increasing local job prospects and ensuring that enabling technologies are readily available to students, researchers, business executives and regulatory agencies all over the world. Partnering with organizations like the international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition can engage local communities and connect them with counterparts internationally. 

Building knowledge, tools and data commons: The genetic code is a foundational toolset enabling synthetic biology to solve global challenges. These resources, however, are not effectively connected or accessible. Building a shared, global commons of digital sequence information (DSI)215 and other resources will improve access and accelerate innovation. Making the knowledge, tools and technologies to leverage DSI available through partnerships, databases and repositories will be critical. Establishing solutions that adhere to FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) can enhance equity and the positive impact of DSI, tools and technologies. Strategies for operationalizing this pathway include: 
– Establish a global commons fund. A global fund devoted to the production and sharing of DSI and other tools and resources without future restrictions on use will enable innovation. This alleviates the need for complicated tracking mechanisms while ensuring sustainability of the resource and incentives for contributors. Numerous tool and databases already exist; linking these through a central source will deliver benefits to all. The fund should be financed by country members, industry and research communities. 
– Develop a network of regional DSI producing centres. Part of the fund can establish a centre devoted to sequencing local biodiversity and curating knowledge critical to its use. The investment can extend to establishment of biofoundries for innovation. 
– Enhance biodiversity conservation and build local communities. Long-term benefits of investment require supporting communities and environments. Focusing regional centres on community development and conservation will enable them to become nucleate points for activities. 
These shared commons provide a framework for delivering the values that should be embedded in synthetic biology’s development.
